      <div class="i-am-a-multidiscipli">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a multidisciplinary Designer that creates
        enchanting digital and physical experiences. My main focus is on XD but
        I also have great UX/UI skills and I'm fascinated by accessibility.
        <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My work can be seen at Denver International
        Airport, The Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, and the Department of
        Architecture at The University of Colorado to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        have had work featured in Modern in Denver Magazine and have had the
        pleasure of being a panelist for TED Talks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I am
        continually learning! I just completed a course through the University
        of Denver on UX/UI and Design Thinking to be better equipped at creating
        unique experiences for my clients.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently
        living in Denver with my lovely rabbit.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;Spanning the 5th floor of a historic theater, The Palace Loft
      is a “Place For Friends” for a magnanemous community leader who is
      passionate about hosting.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchen is open with an
      intentionally shared waterfall table/ countertop to the main living area.
      It creates the sense that they easily flow right into each other.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      curved steel wall with a deep steel doorway is geared more toward private,
      individual space with an expansive landscaped roof garden and fireplace
      adjacent to the master suite.

        >&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the most enchanting spaces in the world need a
        little help with their web presence. This Dojo is one of those places.
        Nestled in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in Nashville, the
        volunteer run organization was finding it more difficult to fill their
        beginner classes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Using interviews with stake holders,
        new members, and regular people we identified the main cause of the
        drop-off in enrollment: website navigation. We reorganized the
        information hierarchy on the site and added a menu to allow visitors to
        quickly access the classes and sign up. We are currently looking for the
        best hosting site to bring the changes live. <br /></span
