        >&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the most enchanting spaces in the world need a little help with their web presence. This Dojo is one of those
        places. Nestled in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in Nashville, the volunteer run organization was finding it more difficult to
        fill their beginner classes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Using interviews with stake holders, new members, and regular people we identified
        the main cause of the drop-off in enrollment: website navigation. We reorganized the information hierarchy on the site and added a
        menu to allow visitors to quickly access the classes and sign up. We are currently looking for the best hosting site to bring the
        changes live. <br /></span
